• Your GitHub username

No rush - you can respond whenever convenient! 😊
```

**Project Discovery Flow:**

```
PMO Agent: Thanks for the introductions! Now I'd love to learn about our current projects.

Could someone help me understand:
• What projects are we actively working on?
• Which GitHub repositories are associated with each project?
• Who are the main contributors for each project?
• What's the current status and priority of each project?

I'll use this to set up our project tracking in Notion.
```
