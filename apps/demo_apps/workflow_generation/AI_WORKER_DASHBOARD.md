### Data Model
- **AIWorker**: Core workflow definition with metadata, graph, and execution history
- **ExecutionRecord**: Individual workflow run with timing, status, and results
- **NodeExecution**: Individual node execution within a workflow run
- **LogEntry**: Structured log entries with timestamps, levels, and node associations

### Integration Ready
The dashboard is designed to integrate with the existing monorepo backend:
- **API Service**: Pre-built HTTP client for all workflow operations
- **React Hooks**: Custom hooks for data fetching and real-time updates
- **SSE Support**: Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- **Authentication**: JWT token support for secured API calls

## Usage

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (port 5554)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Backend Integration
To connect with the actual backend APIs:

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   ```

2. **Replace Mock Data**:
   ```typescript
   // In components, replace mockData imports with API hooks
   import { useWorkflows } from '../hooks/useApi';

   // Instead of: const [workers] = useState(mockAIWorkers);
   const { workflows: workers, loading, error } = useWorkflows();
   ```

3. **Authentication**:
   ```typescript
   // Store JWT token in localStorage
   localStorage.setItem('auth_token', 'your-jwt-token');
   ```

### Key Endpoints Expected
- `GET /api/app/workflows` - List all workflows
- `GET /api/app/workflows/{id}` - Get workflow details
- `POST /api/app/workflows/{id}/execute` - Execute workflow
- `GET /api/app/executions/{id}` - Get execution status
- `GET /api/app/workflows/{id}/stream` - SSE for real-time updates

## Demo Data

The dashboard includes comprehensive mock data featuring 6 different AI workers:

1. **Customer Support Agent** - Event-triggered ticket processing
2. **Social Media Monitor** - Scheduled social media scanning
3. **Lead Qualification Bot** - Webhook-based lead scoring (currently running)
4. **Content Generator** - Scheduled content creation (error state)
5. **Invoice Processor** - File-upload triggered document processing (paused)
6. **DevOps Alert Manager** - Webhook-based incident management

Each worker includes:
- Realistic workflow graphs with multiple node types
- Execution history with various outcomes
- Detailed logs with different log levels
- Real-time execution simulation for active workflows

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **React Router** for navigation
- **ReactFlow** for workflow visualization
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **date-fns** for date formatting
- **clsx** for conditional classes
- **Vite** for build tooling

## Deployment

The dashboard is containerized and ready for deployment:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 5554
CMD ["npm", "run", "preview"]
```

The application runs on port 5554 and is fully self-contained with mock data for demonstration purposes.
