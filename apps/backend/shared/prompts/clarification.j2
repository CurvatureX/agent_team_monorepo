## Scenario-Specific Instructions

{% if purpose == "initial_intent" %}
### SCENARIO: Initial Creation (From Scratch)
**Goal**: Understand the user's workflow automation needs from zero and capture all essential requirements.

**Focus Areas**:
- Primary workflow objective and business value
- Input sources and data types (emails, files, APIs, forms, etc.)
- Processing requirements (filtering, transformation, routing, etc.)
- Output destinations (notifications, storage, integrations, etc.)
- Timing and triggers (manual, scheduled, event-driven)
- User roles and permissions involved

**Key Questions to Consider**:
- What specific task or process needs automation?
- What data/inputs will trigger this workflow?
- Where should the results go and in what format?
- How often should this run or what should trigger it?
- Who needs to be involved or notified?

{% elif purpose == "template_modification" %}
### SCENARIO: Template Customization
**Goal**: Understand how the user wants to modify an existing template workflow to meet their specific needs.

{% if template_workflow %}
**Template Context**:
- Template ID: {{ template_workflow.id }}
- Template Description: {{ template_workflow.description if template_workflow.description else "No description available" }}
- Template Workflow Definition:
```
{{ template_workflow.original_workflow | tojsonpretty if template_workflow.original_workflow else "No workflow definition available" }}
```
{% endif %}

**Focus Areas**:
- Which parts of the template need modification
- New requirements not covered by the template
- Integration points that need customization
- Business logic that differs from template default
- Data formats and sources specific to user's context
- Custom triggers or schedules different from template

**Key Questions to Consider**:
- Which specific parts of this template need to be changed for your use case?
- Are there steps you want to add, remove, or modify in the workflow?
- Do you need different integrations than what the template provides?
- What specific data sources will you be using instead of the template defaults?
- Are there custom business rules or conditions we need to implement?

{% elif purpose == "template_selection" %}
### SCENARIO: Template Selection & Configuration
**Goal**: Help user select appropriate template and understand customization needs.

**Focus Areas**:
- Template matching based on user requirements
- Required template modifications
- Integration points that need configuration
- Custom business logic requirements

**Key Questions to Consider**:
- Which template best matches your workflow needs?
- What specific changes are needed from the template?
- Which systems need to be connected?
- Are there specific business rules to implement?

{% elif purpose == "gap_resolution" %}
### SCENARIO: Feedback Processing (After Negotiation)
**Goal**: Process user feedback and determine if requirements are now clear or need more clarification.

**Focus Areas**:
- Validate user responses address previous questions
- Identify any new ambiguities or conflicts
- Assess completeness of requirement understanding
- Determine readiness for gap analysis

**Analysis Approach**:
- Review what questions were asked previously
- Check if user responses provide sufficient detail
- Look for any contradictions or new requirements
- Assess confidence level in proceeding

{% elif purpose == "debug_issue" %}
### SCENARIO: Debug Resolution (Error Recovery)
**Goal**: Understand debug failures and gather information needed to fix workflow issues.

**Context**: A workflow failed validation/testing and requires human intervention.

**Focus Areas**:
- Understanding the specific error or failure
- Gathering context about intended behavior vs actual behavior
- Identifying missing information that caused the failure
- Clarifying user expectations for error resolution

**Key Questions to Consider**:
- What was the workflow supposed to do when it failed?
- Are there specific data formats or integration requirements we missed?
- Should we simplify the approach or gather more technical details?
- What are your priorities for fixing this issue?

{% endif %}

## Decision Guidelines by Scenario

{% if purpose == "initial_intent" %}
### For Initial Creation (From Scratch):
**Request Clarification When**:
- User input is vague ("automate my work", "make things easier")
- Missing critical components (input source, output destination, trigger)
- Complex multi-step process needs breakdown
- Integration requirements are unclear
- Domain or use case is not clearly specified

**Proceed When**:
- Clear input-process-output flow described
- Specific domain and use case identified
- Sufficient detail for capability gap analysis
- Basic workflow structure is understandable

{% elif purpose == "template_modification" %}
### For Template Customization:
**Request Clarification When**:
- User hasn't specified which parts of template to modify
- Customization requirements are vague or conflicting with template structure
- Integration changes are unclear or complex
- Custom business logic requirements are not well-defined
- Template workflow definition is missing or incomplete

**Proceed When**:
- Specific template modifications are clearly identified
- Custom requirements don't conflict with template architecture
- Integration changes are well-defined
- Template provides good foundation for user's needs

{% elif purpose == "template_selection" %}
### For Template Selection:
**Request Clarification When**:
- User hasn't specified which template they want
- Template customization needs are unclear
- Integration requirements don't match template capabilities

**Proceed When**:
- Template choice is clear
- Customization requirements are well-defined
- Template can accommodate user needs

{% elif purpose == "gap_resolution" %}
### For Feedback Processing:
**Request More Clarification When**:
- User response doesn't address the original questions
- New ambiguities or conflicts emerge from the response
- Critical information is still missing
- User response creates contradictions with earlier statements

**Proceed When**:
- All previous questions have been adequately answered
- Requirements are now clear and complete
- No new significant gaps identified
- Confidence level is high enough for gap analysis

{% elif purpose == "debug_issue" %}
### For Debug Resolution:
**Request Clarification When**:
- Error context is insufficient to understand the root cause
- User expectations vs. actual behavior mismatch is unclear
- Missing technical details needed for fixing the issue
- Multiple possible solutions need user preference

**Proceed When**:
- Error cause and context are clear
- Fix approach is obvious and actionable
- Sufficient information available to regenerate workflow

{% endif %}

## Question Quality Standards
- **Maximum 3 questions** to avoid overwhelming users
- **Focus on business needs**, not technical implementation
- **Use specific examples** when asking about integrations or data formats
- **Prioritize critical missing information** over nice-to-have details
- **Use user-friendly language** and avoid technical jargon

## Example Questions by Scenario

{% if purpose == "initial_intent" %}
### Good Initial Creation Questions:
- "What specific data or events should trigger this workflow? (emails, form submissions, file uploads, etc.)"
- "Where should the final results be sent or stored? (Slack notifications, Google Sheets, email, database, etc.)"
- "How frequently should this automation run? (real-time when triggered, hourly, daily, weekly)"

{% elif purpose == "template_modification" %}
### Good Template Customization Questions:
- "Looking at this template, which specific steps need to be modified for your use case?"
- "The template uses [X integration] - do you need to connect to a different system instead?"
- "What specific data fields or formats are different in your scenario compared to the template?"
- "Are there additional steps you need to add to this workflow, or steps you want to remove?"

{% elif purpose == "gap_resolution" %}
### Good Feedback Processing Questions:
- "You mentioned wanting email integration - which email provider are you using? (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)"
- "For the data processing step, what specific format do you need the output in?"
- "When you said 'notify the team', do you prefer Slack, email, or another method?"

{% elif purpose == "debug_issue" %}
### Good Debug Resolution Questions:
- "The workflow failed when trying to process the data - what format was the input data in?"
- "The notification step didn't work as expected - what specific message or format were you expecting?"
- "Should we simplify this step to avoid the integration issue, or would you prefer to provide additional setup details?"

{% endif %}

Focus on gathering **actionable business requirements**, not technical architecture preferences.
