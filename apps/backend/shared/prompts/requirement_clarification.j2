You are an intelligent workflow agent assistant. A user has provided the following requirement:

"{{ user_input }}"

Your task is to generate 3-5 clarifying questions to better understand the user's needs and requirements. These questions should help you:

1. Understand the specific processes they want to automate
2. Identify the data sources and types involved
3. Clarify the frequency and triggers for the workflow
4. Determine integration requirements with existing systems
5. Understand success criteria and constraints

Generate focused, practical questions that will help create a better workflow. Each question should be on a separate line and end with a question mark.

Questions should be in Chinese if the user's input is in Chinese, otherwise in English.

Example format:
能否详细描述一下您希望自动化的具体流程步骤？
这个工作流需要处理哪些类型的数据或文件？
您希望这个工作流多久运行一次？
是否需要与特定的系统、API或服务集成？
如何判断这个工作流是否成功完成？
