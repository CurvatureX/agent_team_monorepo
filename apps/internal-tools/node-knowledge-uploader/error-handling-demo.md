# Error Handling Implementation Summary

## Task 7: Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

This task has been successfully implemented with the following enhancements:

### API Route Error Handling (`/api/query`)

1. **Enhanced Error Classification**

   - Added `ErrorType` enum for better error categorization
   - Implemented `classifyError()` function to provide user-friendly error messages
   - Added specific handling for OpenAI API errors (quota, rate limits, authentication)
   - Added database connection and query error handling
   - Added network error detection and handling

2. **Retry Mechanisms**

   - Implemented exponential backoff for OpenAI API calls (max 3 retries)
   - Added linear backoff for database operations (max 2 retries)
   - Added `Retry-After` headers for rate limiting scenarios
   - Automatic retry with increasing delays for transient failures

3. **User-Friendly Error Messages**
   - Specific messages for different error types (quota exceeded, rate limits, network issues)
   - Recovery suggestions included in error responses
   - Graceful degradation messaging for service unavailability

### SearchInterface Component Error Handling

1. **Enhanced Error State Management**

   - Updated error state to include error type, retry information, and user messages
   - Added real-time input validation with visual feedback
   - Implemented comprehensive error classification for different failure scenarios

2. **Service Status Monitoring**

   - Added API status check on component mount
   - Real-time online/offline detection with event listeners
   - Service availability indicators in the UI
   - Graceful degradation warnings when services are unavailable

3. **User Feedback Improvements**

   - Enhanced error display with categorized error types (validation, network, server, rate limit)
   - Visual error indicators with appropriate icons and colors
   - Retry buttons for retryable errors with cooldown periods
   - Real-time validation feedback with character count and validation status
   - Service status indicator showing online/offline state and node count

4. **Input Validation**

   - Real-time query validation with immediate feedback
   - Character count with color-coded warnings
   - Prevention of invalid characters and malformed queries
   - Visual validation indicators (green/red dots)

5. **Network Resilience**
   - Request timeout handling (30 seconds)
   - Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Online/offline event handling
   - Connection restoration detection

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **API error handling for OpenAI and Supabase failures**

- Comprehensive error classification and retry logic
- Specific handling for quota limits, rate limits, and authentication errors
- Database connection failure handling with retries

✅ **User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions**

- Contextual error messages based on error type
- Clear recovery instructions for users
- Retry timing information displayed to users

✅ **Retry mechanisms for transient failures**

- Exponential backoff for OpenAI API (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Linear backoff for database operations (1s, 2s delays)
- Automatic retry with proper cooldown periods

✅ **Input validation with real-time feedback**

- Character count with visual warnings
- Real-time validation status indicators
- Prevention of invalid queries and characters
- Immediate feedback on validation errors

✅ **Graceful degradation for service unavailability**

- Service status monitoring and display
- Offline/online detection and handling
- Graceful UI degradation when services are unavailable
- Clear messaging about service limitations

### Error Types Handled

1. **Validation Errors**: Invalid input, empty queries, character limits
2. **Network Errors**: Connection failures, timeouts, offline state
3. **Rate Limit Errors**: OpenAI API rate limiting with retry-after headers
4. **Service Unavailable**: OpenAI quota exceeded, database unavailable
5. **Server Errors**: Internal server errors, database query failures

### User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Error Indicators**: Color-coded error messages with appropriate icons
- **Retry Functionality**: Smart retry buttons with cooldown periods
- **Service Status**: Real-time service availability indicators
- **Input Feedback**: Immediate validation feedback with visual cues
- **Recovery Guidance**: Clear instructions on how to resolve issues

The implementation provides comprehensive error handling that meets all the requirements specified in the task, ensuring a robust and user-friendly search experience even when failures occur.
